    "If you are using TensorFlow 2, you can use the Amazon SageMaker prebuilt TensorFlow 2 framework container with training scripts similar to those you would use outside SageMaker. This notebook presents such a workflow, including all key steps such as preprocessing data with SageMaker Processing, and model training and deployment with SageMaker hosted training and inference. Automatic Model Tuning in SageMaker is used to tune the model's hyperparameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Working through these steps in a notebook is part of the prototyping process; however, a repeatable production workflow typically is run outside notebooks. To demonstrate automating the workflow, we'll use [Amazon SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines) for workflow orchestration. Purpose-built for machine learning (ML), SageMaker Pipelines helps you automate different steps of the ML workflow including data processing, model training, and batch prediction (scoring), and apply conditions such as approvals for model quality. It also includes a model registry and model lineage tracker.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To enable you to run this notebook within a reasonable time (typically less than an hour), this notebook's use case is a straightforward regression task:  predicting house prices based on the well-known Boston Housing dataset. This public dataset contains 13 features regarding housing stock of towns in the Boston area.  Features include average number of rooms, accessibility to radial highways, adjacency to a major river, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we'll import some necessary packages and set up directories for training and test data.  We'll also set up a SageMaker Session to perform various operations, and specify an Amazon S3 bucket to hold input data and output.  The default bucket used here is created by SageMaker if it doesn't already exist, and named in accordance with the AWS account ID and AWS Region.  "
